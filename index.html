    <h1>About Me: Nasrom Yusoff</h1>
    <img src="me.jpg" alt="My Photo" class="photos" id="myphoto" style="width:200px;height:auto;" />
    <p>Hello! I'm Nasrom Yusoff, and I work in pathology as a digital onboarding specialist.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for technology and helping others solve their tech-related issues.</p>
    <p>A few things about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have a daughter in kindergarten.</li>
        <li>My wife is a SAHM, but she sometimes works part-time when she wants.</li>
        <li>I enjoy gaming and watching TV shows and movies when I get the chance (which is rare these days).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A long-term goal I would like to achieve from this bootcamp is to pivot into a career in tech.</p>
    <p>A 'shorter-term' goal is to develop an apartment management app/website that I can use,<br>
        as I am currently involved in the management of the apartment where I live and those apps are pricey.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.</p>
