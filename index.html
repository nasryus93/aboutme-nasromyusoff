    <p>Hello! I'm Nasrom Yusoff, and I work in pathology as a digital onboarding specialist.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for technology and helping others solve their problems with technology.</p>
    <p>
        <ul>A few things about me:
            <li>I have a daughter in kindergarten</li>
            <li>My wife is a SAHM, but she sometimes works part-time when she wants</li>
            <li>I enjoy TV shows, movies, and gaming if I get the chance (very rare these days)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>A long-term goal I would like to achieve from this bootcamp is to pivot into a career in tech.</p>
    <p>A 'shorter-term' goal is to develop an apartment management app/website that I can use,<br>
        as I am currently involved in the management of the apartment where I live. And those apps are pricey!</p>
    <p>
